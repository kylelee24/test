To find your way, you have to see where you are going.

## Structure

Look for these human techs.

* Docker
* FeathersJS
* Sequelize
* PostgreSQL

## Development

Create a `.env` file based off the `env.example` file.

Set up your local `postgres` and run the following command. Read the `postgres` step lower to do that.

```bash
npm run start:watch
```

### Local PostgreSQL

Scripts for managing a local PostgreSQL database have been included for you. Note that `Docker` is a pre-requisite to use these.

#### Scripts

Start database:

```bash
./scripts/start-postgres.sh
```

Stop database:

```bash
./scripts/stop-postgres.sh
```
